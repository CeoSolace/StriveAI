I am striveAI, a mathematics assistant trained exclusively on the British curriculum. I use UK terminology, notation, and methods. I explain concepts clearly, step by step, and always in English.

**Number & Place Value (Key Stage 1–2)**  
In the UK, we use the decimal number system. Whole numbers are positive integers: 0, 1, 2, 3, …  
Place value: In 347, the '3' is in the hundreds place (300), '4' in tens (40), '7' in units (7).  
We read 1,250 as "one thousand two hundred and fifty".  
Counting forwards and backwards, including through zero to negative numbers.  
Round numbers to the nearest 10, 100, or 1000. For example, 472 rounded to the nearest 10 is 470.

**Addition & Subtraction**  
Use column addition and subtraction with carrying and borrowing.  
Example:  
  456  
+ 278  
------  
  734  

Check subtraction using addition: 734 – 278 = 456.

**Multiplication & Division**  
Times tables up to 12 × 12 are essential.  
Short multiplication: 234 × 6 = 1,404.  
Long multiplication: 45 × 23 = (45 × 20) + (45 × 3) = 900 + 135 = 1,035.  
Short division: 846 ÷ 6 = 141.  
Long division: 987 ÷ 13 = 75 remainder 12, or 75.923… as a decimal.

**Fractions, Decimals & Percentages**  
A fraction has a numerator (top) and denominator (bottom).  
Equivalent fractions: 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6.  
Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by the highest common factor (HCF).  
Add fractions with common denominators: 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5.  
With different denominators, find the lowest common multiple (LCM): 1/3 + 1/4 = 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12.  
Convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages:  
  1/2 = 0.5 = 50%  
  3/4 = 0.75 = 75%  
  1/3 ≈ 0.333… = 33.3% recurring  

Percentages: Find 20% of £80 → 0.20 × 80 = £16.  
Percentage increase: £50 increased by 15% → £50 × 1.15 = £57.50.  
Percentage decrease: £60 reduced by 25% → £60 × 0.75 = £45.

**Ratio & Proportion**  
A ratio compares quantities: 3:2 means for every 3 parts of A, there are 2 parts of B.  
Simplify ratios by dividing by the HCF: 12:18 = 2:3.  
Share £100 in the ratio 3:2 → total parts = 5 → £60 and £40.  
Direct proportion: If 4 pens cost £2.40, then 1 pen costs £0.60, so 7 pens cost £4.20.

**Algebra (Key Stage 3–5)**  
Use letters to represent unknowns.  
Simplify expressions: 3x + 2x = 5x; 4a – a + 2 = 3a + 2.  
Expand brackets: 3(x + 4) = 3x + 12; (x + 2)(x + 3) = x² + 5x + 6.  
Factorise: x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3).  
Solve linear equations:  
  2x + 5 = 13 → 2x = 8 → x = 4.  
  3(x – 2) = x + 4 → 3x – 6 = x + 4 → 2x = 10 → x = 5.

**Sequences**  
Arithmetic sequence: constant difference. Example: 5, 9, 13, 17, … (common difference = 4).  
nth term: aₙ = a + (n – 1)d → here, aₙ = 5 + (n – 1)4 = 4n + 1.  
Geometric sequence: constant ratio. Example: 2, 6, 18, 54, … (common ratio = 3).  
nth term: aₙ = arⁿ⁻¹ → here, aₙ = 2 × 3ⁿ⁻¹.

**Graphs**  
Plot y = mx + c: m is gradient, c is y-intercept.  
Gradient = (change in y)/(change in x).  
Parallel lines have equal gradients. Perpendicular lines have gradients that multiply to –1.  
Quadratic graphs: y = x² is a parabola opening upwards.  
Cubic graphs: y = x³ has a point of inflection at the origin.

**Geometry & Measures**  
Angles:  
  - Acute < 90°, right = 90°, obtuse > 90° and < 180°, reflex > 180°.  
  - Angles on a straight line sum to 180°.  
  - Angles around a point sum to 360°.  
  - Vertically opposite angles are equal.  

Triangles:  
  - Equilateral: all sides and angles equal (60° each).  
  - Isosceles: two equal sides, two equal angles.  
  - Scalene: all sides and angles different.  
  - Sum of interior angles = 180°.  

Quadrilaterals:  
  - Square: 4 equal sides, 4 right angles.  
  - Rectangle: opposite sides equal, 4 right angles.  
  - Parallelogram: opposite sides parallel and equal.  
  - Trapezium: one pair of parallel sides (UK definition).  

Area formulas:  
  - Rectangle: length × width  
  - Triangle: ½ × base × height  
  - Parallelogram: base × height  
  - Trapezium: ½(a + b) × height, where a and b are parallel sides  

Circles:  
  - Circumference = πd = 2πr  
  - Area = πr²  
  - Use π ≈ 3.14 or leave answers in terms of π (e.g., 25π cm²)

**Pythagoras’ Theorem & Trigonometry (GCSE)**  
In a right-angled triangle: a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse.  
Example: sides 5 cm and 12 cm → hypotenuse = √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13 cm.

Trigonometric ratios (SOHCAHTOA):  
  - sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse  
  - cos(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse  
  - tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent  

Use to find missing sides or angles.  
Example: In a triangle, angle = 30°, hypotenuse = 10 cm → opposite = 10 × sin(30°) = 10 × 0.5 = 5 cm.

**Probability**  
Probability = (number of favourable outcomes) / (total number of outcomes).  
Range: 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).  
Example: Probability of rolling a 4 on a fair die = 1/6.  
Independent events: P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B).  
Mutually exclusive: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).

**Statistics**  
Mean = total ÷ number of values.  
Median = middle value when ordered.  
Mode = most frequent value.  
Range = highest – lowest.  

Construct and interpret:  
  - Bar charts, pie charts, line graphs  
  - Frequency tables, cumulative frequency curves  
  - Box plots (showing min, LQ, median, UQ, max)

**GCSE Higher Tier & A-Level Core Maths**  
**Surds**: √12 = √(4×3) = 2√3. Rationalise denominators: 1/√2 = √2/2.  
**Indices**:  
  - aᵐ × aⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ  
  - aᵐ ÷ aⁿ = aᵐ⁻ⁿ  
  - (aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ  
  - a⁰ = 1, a⁻¹ = 1/a, a^(1/2) = √a  

**Quadratic equations**: Solve x² – 5x + 6 = 0 → (x–2)(x–3)=0 → x=2 or 3.  
Use quadratic formula: x = [–b ± √(b² – 4ac)] / 2a.  
Discriminant D = b² – 4ac:  
  - D > 0 → two real roots  
  - D = 0 → one repeated root  
  - D < 0 → no real roots  

**Simultaneous equations**:  
  2x + y = 7  
  x – y = 2  
Add equations: 3x = 9 → x = 3, then y = 1.

**Inequalities**:  
  - 2x + 3 > 7 → 2x > 4 → x > 2  
  - Represent on number lines; use open/closed circles.

**Functions**: f(x) = 2x + 1. Composite: fg(x) = f(g(x)). Inverse: f⁻¹(x) = (x – 1)/2.

**Calculus (A-Level)**  
Differentiation:  
  - dy/dx of xⁿ is nxⁿ⁻¹  
  - d/dx (3x² + 2x + 1) = 6x + 2  
  - Gradient of curve at a point = derivative at that x-value  

Integration:  
  - ∫ xⁿ dx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) + C (n ≠ –1)  
  - ∫ (6x + 2) dx = 3x² + 2x + C  
  - Definite integral from a to b gives area under curve.

**A-Level Further Maths**  
**Complex numbers**: i² = –1. z = a + bi. Modulus |z| = √(a² + b²).  
**Matrices**: 2×2 matrix multiplication, determinants, inverses.  
**Proof**:  
  - Proof by deduction  
  - Proof by exhaustion  
  - Disproof by counter-example  

**Numerical methods**:  
  - Iteration: xₙ₊₁ = g(xₙ) to solve f(x) = 0  
  - Newton-Raphson: x₁ = x₀ – f(x₀)/f’(x₀)

**UK Exam Conventions**  
- Always show working — method marks are awarded.  
- Give exact answers unless asked to round (e.g., to 3 significant figures).  
- Use correct units: cm, m², kg, etc.  
- In probability, fractions are preferred unless decimal is specified.  
- In geometry, reasons must be given (e.g., "angles in a triangle sum to 180°").
